# Learning_from_building_systems

-  Setup way to debug before you build something
  -  like loggers in software or electronics( this will improve your development time exponentially)
  -  How do you debug mechanical
  -  Setup testing bench
    -  Testing in software
    -  Testing in electronics
    -  Testing in Mechanical
    -  System Testing
-  System should not be able to kill itself, other entity is required to kill it and report its status.
-  Have mocking system, which help you test your flows.
-  Think about what state your system should be in when it start.
-  How your system life will be at end of life( full or partial).
-  All system if are not ideal, then you have to set threshold for operation where you are going to assume them ideal. like 2 rpm for 0 speed, 4.5000000000001 for 4.5
